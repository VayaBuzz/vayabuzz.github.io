Hi, I'm Patrick Coffey, Full Stack Software Engineer.

Since coffee gives you a buzz, I thought coffey.buzz would be a funny name for my domain, heehee.

And [GT's Buzz](https://www.gatech.edu/prospective-students/where-is-buzz) is the coolest mascot ever. :-) 


I've lived in frigid Minnesota, friendly Texas, sunny Florida, fabulous Las Vegas, and currently Duluth, Georgia.

I played alto sax for five years in the Georgia Tech marching band, and was section leader, too.

I solve interesting problems in Javascript for a living.

I'm blessed with a lovely wife, silly twin daughters, and an orange cat named Emma.
