Hi, I'm Patrick Coffey.

I've lived in frigid Minnesota, friendly Texas, sunny Florida, fabulous Las Vegas, and currently Duluth, Georgia.

I played alto sax for five years in the Georgia Tech marching band, and was section leader, too.

I solve interesting problems in Javascript for a living.

I'm blessed with a lovely wife, silly twin daughters, and an orange cat named Emma.
