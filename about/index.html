<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Patrick Coffey.

<p>I've lived in frigid Minnesota, friendly Texas, sunny Florida, fabulous Las Vegas, and currently Duluth, Georgia.

<p>I played alto sax for five years in the Georgia Tech marching band, and was section leader, too.

<p>I solve interesting problems in Javascript for a living.

<p>I'm blessed with a lovely wife, silly twin daughters, and an orange cat named Emma.</p>
