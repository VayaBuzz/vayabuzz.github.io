<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Patrick Coffey. Husband. Dad. Software Engineer.

I've lived in frigid Minnesota, friendly Texas, fantastic Florida, fabulous Las Vegas, and currently Duluth, Georgia.

I played alto sax for five years in the Georgia Tech marching band.

I solve interesting problems in Javascript for a living.

I'm blessed with a lovely wife, silly twin daughters, and an orange cat named Emma.</p>
